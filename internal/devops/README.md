# internal/devops/

Operational guides for the snowflakeR project. These documents are for
contributors and maintainers -- they are **not synced** to the public
repository.

## Documents

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` | Step-by-step: commit → regenerate docs → sync to public repo |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributor onboarding: prerequisites, setup, architecture, style guide |
| `README.md` | This file |

## Supersedes

These documents replace the following outdated files (which can be removed
once the team has transitioned):

- `DEVELOPMENT.md` (repo root) — old dev guide referencing `r_notebook/` sync
- `internal/Public_Repo_Sync_Guide.md` — old sync guide for `sf_workspace_notebook_r_integration`
