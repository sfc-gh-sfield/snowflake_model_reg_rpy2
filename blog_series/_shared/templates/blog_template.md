> **Note:** The `snowflakeR` package described in this series is a passion
> project that gives R users an idiomatic interface to the
> `snowflake-ml-python` SDK and Snowflake's server-side ML capabilities --
> including the Model Registry, Feature Store, and Snowpark -- enabling
> end-to-end ML workflows from R that are fully interoperable with Python.
> It is not yet officially supported by Snowflake, but is provided to help
> customers use R within Snowflake Workspaces and Containers, and to solicit
> feedback that will help improve product integration for R users. APIs and
> capabilities may change.
