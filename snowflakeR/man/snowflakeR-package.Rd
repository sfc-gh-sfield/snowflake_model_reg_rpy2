\title{snowflakeR: R Interface to the Snowflake ML Platform}
\description{
Provides native R functions for working with the Snowflake ML platform, including Model Registry (log, deploy, and serve R models), Feature Store (create and manage feature views using dplyr/dbplyr or SQL), and data connectivity. Uses 'reticulate' to bridge to the 'snowflake-ml-python' SDK while presenting an idiomatic R API. Supports both Snowflake Workspace Notebooks and local R environments. Integrates with 'snowflakeauth' for 'connections.toml'/'config.toml' credential management when available.
