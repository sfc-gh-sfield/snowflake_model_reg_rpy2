Description: Provides native R functions for working with the Snowflake ML
    platform, including Model Registry (log, deploy, and serve R models),
    Feature Store (create and manage feature views using dplyr/dbplyr or SQL),
    and REST inference to SPCS model serving endpoints. Uses 'reticulate' to
    bridge to the 'snowflake-ml-python' SDK for ML operations. Standard
    database connectivity (DBI, dbplyr) is provided by the 'RSnowflake'
    package. Supports both Snowflake Workspace Notebooks and local R
    environments.
