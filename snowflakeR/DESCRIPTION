Maintainer: Simon Field <simon.field@snowflake.com>
Description: Provides native R functions for working with the Snowflake ML
    platform, including Model Registry (log, deploy, and serve R models),
    Feature Store (create and manage feature views using dplyr/dbplyr or SQL),
    and data connectivity. Uses 'reticulate' to bridge to the
    'snowflake-ml-python' SDK while presenting an idiomatic R API. Supports
    both Snowflake Workspace Notebooks and local R environments. Integrates
    with 'snowflakeauth' for 'connections.toml'/'config.toml' credential
    management when available.
