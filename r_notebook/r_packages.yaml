# R Package Configuration for Snowflake Workspace Notebooks
# =========================================================
#
# This file defines the R packages to install into the micromamba r_env.
# Edit this file to customize your R environment.
#
# Package Types:
# --------------
# conda_packages: Installed via micromamba from conda-forge
#                 Use conda package names (e.g., r-tidyverse, r-dplyr)
#                 Preferred for packages with complex dependencies
#
# cran_packages:  Installed via install.packages() from CRAN
#                 Use standard R package names (e.g., prophet, fable)
#                 Requires outbound HTTP access to CRAN
#
# Note: Packages listed here are installed during the base R setup.
#       ADBC packages are installed separately when using --adbc flag.

# Conda-forge packages (package names as they appear in conda-forge)
conda_packages:
  - r-base           # Required: Base R installation
  - r-tidyverse      # Data manipulation and visualization (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, etc.)
  - r-lazyeval       # Required for some tidyverse operations
  - reticulate       # R interface to Python (useful for advanced interop)

# CRAN packages (standard R package names)
# These are installed after conda packages via install.packages()
# Uncomment packages as needed
cran_packages: []
  # - prophet        # Time series forecasting
  # - fable          # Tidy time series forecasting
  # - shiny          # Web applications
  # - caret          # Machine learning
